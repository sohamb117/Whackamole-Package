	<h5> Step by Step </h5>
	<p> Here's a rudimentary step-by-step, feel free to work however you want though. </p>

	<ul>
	<li>Start by going through all demos and clearly understanding them. Think about how you could use them in your own code.</li>
	<li>Go through your HTML, JS, and CSS files. Read any comments and complete any immediate tasks you notice. <b> Hint: </b>One is to link your JS file in your HTML code.</li>
	<li>Start your JS by adding constants that refer to HTML elements that you'll be using</li>
	<li>Write the relocate function - it handles what happens when a mole is clicked. Also, remember to add the onClick bind.</li>
	<li>Write the timer function. This will keep track of the time to make sure that the game ends when time runs out, and that the timer keeps going down. Refer to the examples!</li>
	<li>Write the game state management. This can work however you want, just make sure that it ends the game when the timer hits 0.</li>
	<li>Test and customize! Add new functionality, animations, features, and maybe even gameplay mechanics! Or, just change how it looks! Have fun!</li>
