# Whackamole

**Time:**: 90 Minutes  
**Languages:** HTML/CSS/JS


Whackamole is a "reverse" workshop. This means that club members will be building this workshop *on their own.* This allows them to explore how to think programatically.

### Running This Workshop

Your goals as a club leader are to help members understand the code and think of implementations on their own. 
Here's a few things to keep in mind:
* Provide all resources to start and show how each one works
* Go through one demo line by line to provide an example of how members should read code
* Walk around and regularly check in with members to see if people need help
* Build your own version before the meeting (preferrably with the demos)


Now, let's get into how to run the workshop. The workshop *does* require more time than most; expect it to take around 90 minutes to provide ample time for hacking and further development. 
Here's a time breakdown on how you should run the meeting:
* **Introduction -** 15 min  
Let all members settle down. Introduce the workshop and the live demo, and provide all links
* **Getting Started -** 10 min  
Go through one example line by line. Ensure that everyone understands the code.
* **Working** - 50 min  
Let members build the project. Walk around and answer questions. Refer to the demos often, and sit down with members to show them how the code works. Ask them how demo code might fit into their own projects, but *don't* tell them the answers.
* **Conclusions** - 15 min  
Add in any conclusions, suggest future improvements, and close the meeting however you like.

Here's a few quick tips to make your meeting more engaging in general:
* Walk around the room
* Ask questions to club members
* Check in with people who are doing well
* Play music while working
